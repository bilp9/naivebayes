# 🏨 Hotel Review Rating Prediction (NLP with Naive Bayes & Logistic Regression)

This project uses natural language processing to predict hotel review ratings based on user-written review text. The analysis involves cleaning a real-world dataset, visualizing insights, and building two machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Data cleaning & EDA
- Visualizations of ratings and top review cities
- TF-IDF vectorization for better word weighting
- Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression model comparison
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Summary insights and recommendations

## 📈 Results
- Best performance on frequent rating classes (especially rating 5)
- Logistic Regression outperformed Naive Bayes (F1: 0.49 vs 0.45)
- Rare ratings (6–10) were difficult to predict due to imbalance

## 📦 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## 🚀 Run This Notebook
1. Clone the repo or open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset (`hotel reviews.csv`)
3. Run cells from top to bottom
